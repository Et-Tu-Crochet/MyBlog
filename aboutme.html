                        <h3>I am majoring in Computer Science.</h3>
                        <p>I am currently taking programming 3 and Front End Development.
                            I have always been fascinated with coding but completely intimidated. 
                            However, after the pandemic hit, I was facing a total life change.
                            I had lost my job and began looking at going back to school. Before 
                            diving into paying money for something I did not know if I would be 
                            interested in, I began learning a bit about coding first. I realized how 
                            similar writing code was to writing crochet patterns and decided to take
                            the leap.
